# Fairfare

Fairfare is an all in one website where you can find the cheapest transportation options to get to a destination. We will be building the frontend with React and Typescript. The backend will be Flask with a MongoDB Atlas database. It could be containerized in Docker and use the GoDaddy Registry.
